All participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others.
All interactions should be professional regardless of platform: either online or in-person.

In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviors in all CCDL training events and platforms:

- Use welcoming and inclusive language

- Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences

- Gracefully accept constructive criticism

- Focus on what is best for the community

- Show courtesy and respect towards other community members

### Unacceptable behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants at any CCDL training event/platform include:

- written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group

- causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation

- violent threats or language directed against another person

- the display of sexual or violent images

- unwelcome sexual attention

- nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact

- sustained disruption of talks, events or communications

- insults or put downs

- sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes

- excessive swearing

- incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm

- continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop

- publication of private communication without consent

If you feel harassed or treated inappropriately at any time, please contact the Director of the CCDL at [ccdl@alexslemonade.org](mailto:ccdl@alexslemonade.org)

### Consequences of Unacceptable behavior

Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately.
This applies to any CCDL training events and platforms, either online or in-person.
If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the organizers may warn the offender or require them to leave the event or platform.
