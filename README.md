# CCDL RNA-Seq-Exercises

The [Childhood Cancer Data Lab](ccdatalab.org) is developing a series of short course modules to train researchers studying childhood cancer to perform reproducible analyses.

This module focuses on the analysis of RNA-seq data. To set up your Docker
RNA-seq environment, you need to follow the instructions specified in the [schedule](schedule.md)
under "Getting Started". Setting up this environment will
provide you with all the software and packages you need for the [RNA-seq workshop modules](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/training-modules).

Briefly, you need to have successfully installed [Docker](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/training-modules/blob/master/docker-install/README.md). Then you need to [obtain the workshop data from the flash drives](flashdrive-instructions.md)

Lastly there are two different sets of instructions, for setting up your RNA-seq Docker container,
[steps that are dependent on sufficiently fast internet](docker-pull.md) and
[steps that do not require internet but use an image from a flashdrive](docker-load.md).
