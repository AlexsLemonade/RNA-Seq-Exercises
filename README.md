# CCDL RNA-Seq-Exercises

The [Childhood Cancer Data Lab](ccdatalab.org) is developing a series of short course modules to train researchers studying childhood cancer to perform reproducible analyses.

This module focuses on the analysis of RNA-seq data.
We structured this series to include one day on the analysis of a dataset selected by a course director, one day on the analysis of the participants own RNA-seq dataset, and a half-day to touch on some more advanced topics.
Here is the [schedule](schedule.md) for the workshop.
