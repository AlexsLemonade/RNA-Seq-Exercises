# CCDL RNA-Seq-Exercises: Set Up

The [Childhood Cancer Data Lab](ccdatalab.org) is developing a series of short course modules to train researchers studying childhood cancer to perform reproducible analyses.

This module focuses on the analysis of RNA-seq data. Here is the
[schedule](schedule.md) for the workshop.

After you have successfully installed [Docker](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/training-modules/blob/master/docker-install/README.md), now you are ready to set up your Docker container.

To set up your Docker container, follow the instructions specified in the [schedule](schedule.md).
There are two sets of instructions,
[steps that are dependent on sufficiently fast internet](docker-pull.md) and
[steps that do not require internet](docker-load.md).
